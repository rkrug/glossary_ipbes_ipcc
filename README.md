This app was created iteratively with both **Claude Code** and **Codex**
assistance. Contributor details, model/mode metadata, and session history are
documented in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and `AI_PROMPTS.md`.

An R package containing two Shiny apps for comparing and exploring the
[IPBES](https://www.ipbes.net/) biodiversity glossary and the
[IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) climate change glossary.

## Features

- **Comparison app** (`run_app()`):
  - side-by-side glossary comparison with grouped definitions
  - within-source and between-source similarity metrics
  - word-level differences and directed term hierarchy graph
  - optional live IPCC refresh (hosted-safe behavior on shinyapps.io)
- **Glossary explorer app** (`run_glossary()`):
  - source selector (`IPBES`, `IPCC`, `Both`) with autocomplete term lookup
  - in-definition highlighting of glossary terms
  - hover to preview definitions and click highlighted terms to navigate
  - case-insensitive term matching and source-specific rendering

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rkrug/glossary_ipbes_ipcc")
```

## Usage

```r
# Comparison app
glossary.ipbes.ipcc::run_app()

# Glossary explorer app
glossary.ipbes.ipcc::run_glossary()
```

The app stores its cache (updated IPCC data, merged table cache) in
`tools::R_user_dir("glossary.ipbes.ipcc", "cache")`.  No manual setup is
required.

## Hosted apps

- Comparison app: https://rmkrug.shinyapps.io/glossary-ipbes-ipcc/
- Glossary explorer app: https://ipbes-data.shinyapps.io/glossary-ipbes-ipcc-explorer/

## Detailed technical background

For a full implementation walkthrough (scraping, merge logic, similarity
methods, word-level diff interpretation, caching, and local vs hosted behavior),
see [BACKGROUND.md](BACKGROUND.md).

## Deploying to shinyapps.io

Use the compare-app deploy helper:

```bash
SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT=... SHINYAPPS_TOKEN=... SHINYAPPS_SECRET=... \
Rscript scripts/deploy_shinyapps_compare.R
```

This deploys `app_compare.R` and sets hosted-safe mode by default
through runtime detection on shinyapps.io, which disables live IPCC scraping
for hosted instances. Local runs keep live update enabled by default.

Use the glossary-explorer deploy helper:

```bash
SHINYAPPS_ACCOUNT=... SHINYAPPS_APP_NAME=... \
Rscript scripts/deploy_shinyapps_glossary.R
```

This deploys `app_glossary.R` as a separate shinyapps.io app.

## Data sources

| Source | URL | Bundled snapshot |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| IPBES Glossary | https://www.ipbes.net/glossary | `inst/extdata/ipbes_glossary.csv` (2026-02-23, 2,228 terms) |
| IPCC Glossary  | https://apps.ipcc.ch/glossary/ | `inst/extdata/ipcc_glossary.csv` (run `data-raw/prepare_data.R` to regenerate) |

## Developer notes

### Regenerating the bundled IPCC data

The bundled IPCC CSV must be generated before building the package:

```r
source("data-raw/prepare_data.R")
```

This runs the IPCC scraper (takes several minutes) and writes
`inst/extdata/ipcc_glossary.csv`.  Commit the result to git.
