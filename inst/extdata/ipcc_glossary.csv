"495","123","1.5°C pathway","A pathway of emissions of greenhouse gases and other climate forcers that provides an approximately one-in-two to two-in-three chance, given current knowledge of the climate response, of global warming either remaining below 1.5°C or returning to 1.5°C by around 2100 following an overshoot.","SRCCL; SR15; AR6","2026-02-27"
"1","123","1.5°C warmer worlds","Projected worlds in which global warming has reached and, unless otherwise indicated, been limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. There is no single 1.5°C warmer world, and projections of 1.5°C warmer worlds look different depending on whether it is considered on a near-term transient trajectory or at climate equilibrium after several millennia, and, in both cases, if it occurs with or without overshoot. Within the 21st century, several aspects play a role for the assessment of risk and potential impacts in 1.5°C warmer worlds: the possible occurrence, magnitude and duration of an overshoot; the way in which emissions reductions are achieved; the ways in which policies might be able to influence the resilience of human and natural systems; and the nature of the regional and sub-regional risks. Beyond the 21st century, several elements of the climate system would continue to change even if the global mean temperatures remain stable, including further increases of sea level.","SR15; AR6","2026-02-27"

"2528","A","Adjustment time or response time (Ta)","Adjustment time or response time (Ta) is the time scale characterizing the decay of an instantaneous pulse input into the reservoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterize the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in the source strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to quantify a first-order exponential decay process. See Response time for a different definition pertinent to climate variations. 
The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a surrogate for adjustment time. 
In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, the adjustment time equals the turnover time: T = Ta. An example is CFC-11, which is removed from the atmosphere only by photochemical processes in the stratosphere. In more complicated cases, where several reservoirs are involved or where the removal is not proportional to the total mass, the equality T = Ta no longer holds. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an extreme example. Its turnover time is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large part of that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere within a few years. Thus, the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere is actually determined by the rate of removal of carbon from the surface layer of the oceans into its deeper layers. Although an approximate value of 100 years may be given for the adjustment time of CO2 in the atmosphere, the actual adjustment is faster initially and slower later on. In the case of methane (CH4), the adjustment time is different from the turnover time because the removal is mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH), the concentration of which itself depends on the CH4 concentration. Therefore, the CH4 removal rate S is not proportional to its total mass M.","AR5-WG1","2026-02-27"
"5749","A","Adjustments (in relation to effective radiative forcing)","The response to an agent perturbing the climate system that is driven directly by the agent, independently of any change in global surface temperature. For example, carbon dioxide and aerosols, by altering internal heating and cooling rates within the atmosphere, can each cause changes to cloud cover and other variables thereby producing an effective radiative forcing even in the absence of any surface warming or cooling. Adjustments are usually rapid in the sense that they begin to occur right away, before climate feedbacks which are driven by global surface warming (although some adjustments may still take significant time to proceed to completion, for example those involving vegetation or ice sheets).","AR6","2026-02-27"
"2286","A","Advection","Transport of water or air along with its properties (e.g., temperature, chemical tracers) by winds or currents.

"21","A","Aerosol","A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 μm that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours. The term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways: through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow or ice covered surfaces thereby altering their albedo and contributing to climate feedback. Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate from two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter (PM), and formation of secondary PM from gaseous precursors. The bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt, organic carbon, black carbon (BC), mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium. These labels are, however, imperfect as aerosols combine particles to create complex mixtures.","SRCCL; SROCC; SR15; AR5-WG3; AR5-WG1; AR6","2026-02-27"

Demand-side measures (e.g., reducing losses and wastes of food, changes in human diet, or changes in wood consumption) may also play a role.

FOLU (Forestry and Other Land Use) — also referred to as LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) — is the subset of AFOLU emissions and removals of greenhouse gases (GHGs) resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change, and forestry activities excluding agricultural emissions.","AR5-SYR","2026-02-27"

The empirical/statistical methods [are based on observations and] develop statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/ regional climate variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an important limitation on quality of the downscaled information.

This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere–ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections.

"2430","E","Energy budget (of the Earth)","The Earth is a physical system with an energy budget that includes all gains of incoming energy and all losses of outgoing energy. The Earth's energy budget is determined by measuring how much energy comes into the Earth system from the Sun, how much energy is lost to space, and accounting for the remainder on Earth and its atmosphere. Solar radiation is the dominant source of energy into the Earth system. Incoming solar energy may be scattered and reflected by clouds and aerosols or absorbed in the atmosphere. The transmitted radiation is then either absorbed or reflected at the Earth's surface. The average albedo of the Earth is about 0.3, which means that 30% of the incident solar energy is reflected into space, while 70% is absorbed by the Earth. Radiant solar or shortwave energy is transformed into sensible heat, latent energy (involving different water states), potential energy, and kinetic energy before being emitted as infrared radiation.

"5178","G","Gravitational, rotational and deformational (GRD) effects","Changes in Earth gravity, Earth rotation and viscoelastic solid Earth deformation (GRD) result from the redistribution of mass between terrestrial ice and water reservoirs and the ocean. Contemporary terrestrial mass loss leads to elastic solid Earth uplift and a nearby relative sea level fall (for a single source of terrestrial mass loss this is within ~2000 km, for multiple sources the distance depends on the interaction of the different relative sea level patterns). Farther away (more than ~7000 km for a single source of terrestrial mass loss), relative sea level rises more than the global average, due (to first order) to gravitational effects. Earth deformation associated with adding water to the oceans and a shift of the Earth’s rotation axis towards the source of terrestrial mass loss leads to second-order effects that increase spatial variability of the pattern globally. GRD effects due to the redistribution of ocean water within the ocean itself are referred to as self-attraction and loading effects.","AR6","2026-02-27"

"2468","G","Greenhouse effect","The infrared radiative effect of all infrared-absorbing constituents in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases (GHGs), clouds, and (to a small extent) aerosols absorb terrestrial radiation emitted by the earth's surface and elsewhere in the atmosphere. These substances emit infrared radiation in all directions, but, everything else being equal, the net amount emitted to space is normally less than would have been emitted in the absence of these absorbers because of the decline of temperature with altitude in the troposphere and the consequent weakening of emission. An increase in the concentration of GHGs increases the magnitude of this effect; the difference is sometimes called the enhanced greenhouse effect. The change in a GHG concentration because of anthropogenic emissions contributes to an instantaneous radiative forcing. Surface temperature and troposphere warm in response to this forcing, gradually restoring the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere.","AR5-WG3; AR5-WG2; AR5-WG1; SREX; AR6","2026-02-27"

"5503","G","Greenhouse gas emission metric","A simplified relationship used to quantify the effect of emitting a unit mass of a given greenhouse gas (GHG) on a specified key measure of climate change. A relative GHG emission metric expresses the effect from one gas relative to the effect of emitting a unit mass of a reference GHG on the same measure of climate change. There are multiple emission metrics, and the most appropriate metric depends on the application. GHG emission metrics may differ with respect to: (i) the key measure of climate change they consider; (ii) whether they consider climate outcomes for a specified point in time or integrated over a specified time horizon; (iii) the time horizon over which the metric is applied; (iv) whether they apply to a single emission pulse, emissions sustained over a period of time, or a combination of both; and (v) whether they consider the climate effect from an emission compared to the absence of that emission or compared to a reference emissions level or climate state.[Note:Most relative GHG emission metrics (such as the global warming potential (GWP), global temperature change potential (GTP), global damage potential, and GWP*), use carbon dioxide (CO2) as the reference gas. Emissions of non-CO2 gases, when expressed using such metrics, are often referred to as ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ emissions. A metric that establishes equivalence regarding one key measure of the climate system response to emissions does not imply equivalence regarding other key measures. The choice of a metric, including its time horizon, should reflect the policy objectives for which the metric is applied.]","AR6","2026-02-27"
"5519","G","Greenhouse gas neutrality","Condition in which metric-weighted anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with a subject are balanced by metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG removals. The subject can be an entity such as a country, an organisation, a district or a commodity, or an activity such as a service or an event. GHG neutrality is often assessed over the lifecycle, including indirect (‘scope 3’) emissions, but can also be limited to the emissions and removals, over a specified period, for which the subject has direct control, as determined by the relevant scheme. The quantification of GHG emissions and removals depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric[Note 1: Greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero greenhouse gas emissions are overlapping concepts. The concepts can be applied at global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national). At a global scale, the terms greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals under direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, while GHG neutrality generally includes emissions and removals within and beyond the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. Accounting rules specified by GHG programmes or schemes can have a significant influence on the quantification of relevant emissions and removals.Note 2: Under the Paris Rulebook (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 37), parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or GWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs. In addition, parties may use other metrics to report supplemental information on aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs.Note 3: In some cases, achieving greenhouse gas neutrality may rely on the supplementary use of offsets to balance emissions that remain after actions by the reporting entity are taken into account.]","AR6","2026-02-27"

The quantification of net zero GHG emissions depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric.[Note 1: Greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero GHG emissions are overlapping concepts. The concept of net zero GHG emissions can be applied at global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national). At a global scale, the terms GHG neutrality and net zero GHG emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals under direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, while GHG neutrality generally includes anthropogenic emissions and anthropogenic removals within and beyond the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. Accounting rules specified by GHG programmes or schemes can have a significant influence on the quantification of relevant emissions and removals.Note 2: Under the Paris Rulebook (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 37), parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or GWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs.

Extreme poverty is itself a poverty trap, since poor persons lack the means to participate meaningfully in society. In economics, the term poverty trap is often used at national scales, referring to a self-perpetuating condition where an economy, caught in a vicious cycle, suffers from persistent underdevelopment (Matsuyama, 2008).

This quantifies the impact of the constituent on the climate system. Examples include the aerosol-radiation interactions, cloud radiative effect, and greenhouse effect. In this report, the portion of any top-of-atmosphere radiative effect that is due to anthropogenic or other external influences (e.g., volcanic eruptions or changes in the sun) is termed the instantaneous radiative forcing.","AR5-WG1","2026-02-27"

The traditional radiative forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the effective radiative forcing. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, which describes an unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.","SRCCL; SROCC; SR15; AR5-WG3; AR5-SYR; AR5-WG2; AR5-WG1; SREX; AR6","2026-02-27"

In liquid clouds, an increase in cloud droplet concentration and surface area would increase the cloud albedo. This effect is also known as the cloud albedo effect, first indirect effect, or Twomey effect.

"2644","R","Rapid adjustment","The response to an agent perturbing the climate system that is driven directly by the agent, independently of any change in the global mean surface temperature. For example, carbon dioxide and aerosols, by altering internal heating and cooling rates within the atmosphere, can each cause changes to cloud cover and other variables thereby producing a radiative effect even in the absence of any surface warming or cooling. Adjustments are rapid in the sense that they begin to occur right away, before climate feedbacks which are driven by warming (although some adjustments may still take significant time to proceed to completion, for example those involving vegetation or ice sheets). It is also called the rapid response or fast adjustment. For further explanation on the concept, see Sections 7.1 and 8.1.","AR5-WG1","2026-02-27"

Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as CO2, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on CO2 emissions. An energy tax — a levy on the energy content of fuels — reduces demand for energy and so reduces CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use. An ecotax is a carbon, emissions or energy tax designed to influence human behaviour (specifically economic behaviour) to follow an ecologically benign path.

Changes in total alkalinity in the oceans can result from a variety of biogeochemical processes that affect the acid–base composition of the seawater itself. However, its value is not affected by the exchange of carbon dioxide gas between seawater and the atmosphere. Measurements of total alkalinity can thus be used to help study these biogeochemical processes and can also be used to help calculate the state of the seawater acid–base system.

In May and June, rainfall essentially remains along the Guinean coast with a maximum occurring near 5°N, followed by a sudden decrease of rainfall, marking the ‘short dry season‘ in the Guinean coast and the monsoon onset in the Sahel. Then rainfall continues to progress northward up to about 18–20°N, with a maximum near 12°N in late August/September, until it retreats starting from October towards the Guinean coast for a second maximum. Further details on how WAfriM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.","AR6","2026-02-27"

"2070","W","Wind energy","Kinetic energy from air currents arising from uneven heating of the earth's surface. A wind turbine is a rotating machine for converting the kinetic energy of the wind to mechanical shaft energy to generate electricity. A windmill has oblique vanes or sails and the mechanical power obtained is mostly used directly, for example, for water pumping. A wind farm, wind project, or wind power plant is a group of wind turbines interconnected to a common utility system through a system of transformers, distribution lines, and (usually) one substation.","AR5-WG3; SRREN; AR6","2026-02-27"
