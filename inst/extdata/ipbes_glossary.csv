"gender_sua","gender","","The term gender refers to the socially-constructed expectations about the characteristics, aptitudes and behaviors associated with being a woman or a man. Gender defines what is feminine and masculine. Gender shapes the social roles that mean and women play and the power relations between them, which can have a profound effect on the use and management of natural resources. Gender is not based on sex or the biological differences between women and men; rather, gender is shaped by culture and social norms. Thus, depending on values, norms, customs and laws, women and men in different parts of the world have adopted different gender roles and relations. Within the same society, gender roles also differ by race/ethnicity, class/caste, religion, ethnicity, age and economic circumstances. Gender and gender roles then affect the economic, political, social, and ecological opportunities and constraints faced by both women and men (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2017). The framing of sex and gender as binaries is in fact a cultural ideology. The empirical reality is that sex is a spectrum, manifesting in a wide array of sex variance. Some people don't neatly fit into the categories of man or woman, or “male” or “female.” For example, some people have a gender that blends elements of being a man or a woman, or a gender that is different than either male or female. Some people don't identify with any gender, or their gender changes over time.","Sustainable use assessment",NA,24915,41201

"governance_nxs","governance","","An umbrella concept for the full range of means for deciding, managing, implementing and monitoring policies and measures, including the ways that combinations of formal and informal and public and private institutions (including actions, norms, rules and rulemaking systems) are structured, sustained and regulated (IPBES, 2019b, 2023b). Governance approaches determine the processes and channels through which decisions are made and implemented, and how power and responsibilities are distributed and exercised between actors. An inclusive concept of governance recognizes the contributions of many types of actors across a broad range of levels (IPBES, 2022a). Adaptive governance: Refers to governance that enables society to adapt to disturbances and changes by navigating the dynamic, multi-scalar nature of social-ecological-institutional systems (Cosens et al., 2014). In adaptive governance, formal and informal institutions prioritize social learning in planning, implementation and evaluation of policy through iterative social learning to steer the use and protection of natural resources, ecosystem services and common pool natural resources, particularly in situations of complexity and uncertainty (IPCC, 2018). Community governance: Community level management and decision-making that is undertaken by, with, or on behalf of a community, by a group of community stakeholders (Totikidis et al., 2005). Hierarchical governance: Refers to nested levels of state authority, wherein each unit is subordinate to its vertical superior, and in which tasks are divided into more manageable forms (Lukat et al. 2023). Intersectoral governance: Describes distinct entities or procedures within government and administration using the structures in place to facilitate collaboration between various ministries, departments or sectors. Some actions, such as evidence support, objective setting and goal setting can be facilitated by intersectoral governance structures aimed at aligning governance policies (McQueen et al., 2012). Integrated/integrative governance: Broadly seeks to bring together different sectors, actors, policies and/or levels of governance around a specific social-ecological system or problem (Haapasaari et al., 2021). Market governance: Refers to a mode of governance that prioritizes responses to complex issues as best coordinated through the ""invisible hand of the market"" or to a lesser extent, the use of market-driven behavioural change (Bednar & Henstra, 2018). Meta-governance: Refers to governance of governance, which aims to design and manage sound combinations of hierarchical, market and network governance to achieve the best possible outcomes (Meuleman, 2020). Multi-level governance: Relationships and exchanges across multiple levels of jurisdiction and decision-making, including, global, regional, national and local, as well as trans-regional and trans-national levels (IPCC, 2018). Network governance: Refers to a blurring of boundaries between the spheres of public, private and community sectors, e.g., as networks of actors in the water-energy-food nexus (Covarrubias et al., 2019). Nexus governance: In the scope of the nexus assessment, refers to the systematic coordinating structures and processes that enhance the engagement of multiple actors through horizontal (e.g., across various nexus elements at one scale) and vertical (e.g., cross-scale connectivity or multilevel governance) channels to address nexus challenges, identify policy and sociopolitical options, and manage their implementation towards just sustainable futures. Nexus governance aims to achieve policy coherence to meet international and domestic goals and objectives with appropriate response options that manage and minimize trade-offs, while promoting synergies and co-benefits across scales and time, such as through recognizing and supporting the actions of societal actors through arenas of engagement. Five key components are identified as important for nexus governance: integrative, holistic and transdisciplinary framing of problems and solutions; inclusive approaches that bring about enhanced arenas of actor engagement; normative considerations of equity and justice, alongside accountability; enhanced mechanisms and processes for collaboration and coordination across scales and sectors; and adaptive, reflexive and experimental approaches to learn from what works and to scale these solutions (Source: this assessment, Chapters 1 and 4). Polycentric governance: As defined by Ostrom et al. (1961), this refers to the presence of many centres of decision-making, which are formally independent of each other. The decision-making units in a polycentric governance arrangement are often overlapping as they are nested at multiple jurisdictional levels (e.g., local, state and national) and in governance units that cut across jurisdictions (McGinnis & Ostrom, 2012; E. Ostrom, 2009). Studies of nexus interactions, such as across food-energy-water links, have increasingly characterized these systems as polycentric, given roles for governments, intergovernmental and non-state actors through intermediary organisations and soft modes of influence (Villamayor-Tomas, 2018). Reflexive governance: Refers to the ""intentional effort to shape a societal transformation towards sustainability by deliberately employing interactions between manifold actors, overlapping regulatory contexts and interacting spheres of production and consumption"". It encourages ""reflection about societal circumstances in order to reassess practices and adjust initiatives"" (Feindt & Weiland, 2018). Transformative governance: The formal and informal (public and private) rules, rule-making systems and actor-networks at all levels of human society (from local to global) that enable transformative change towards biodiversity conservation and sustainable development more broadly (Visseren-Hamakers et al., 2021; Visseren-Hamakers & Kok, 2022). In the transformative change assessment, transformative governance refers to an alteration of existing configurations of views, structures and practices to enable effective and just biodiversity governance. Actions include integrative governance that revises decision-making processes, an inclusive governance that creates ownership and deliberation among stakeholders, a global and multi-level governance that addresses global interdependencies, as well as an adaptive governance that continuously evaluates and revises regulatory and holds responsible actors accountable for addressing biodiversity related issues (Source: IPBES transformative change assessment).","Nexus assessment",NA,21653,88357

These processes of control (whether through ownership, lease, concession, contracts, quotas, or general power) as well as commons enclosure, have two main purposes: on the one hand, productivist exploitation (speculation, extraction, land stewardship, food sovereignty); on the other hand, conservation (e.g. Protected Areas, no-take’ conservation areas, restoration of endangered habitat, resource control or nature commodification, Biodiversity offsets, REDD+, etc.), qualified either green for land conservation (Benabou, 2014), or blue for ocean conservation (Bennett et al., 2020; Clark Howard, 2018; Cormier- Salem & Bassett, 2007).

Validation (of models) typically refers to checking model outputs for consistency with observations. However, since models cannot be validated in the formal sense of the term (i.e. proven to be true), some scientists prefer to use the words benchmarking or evaluation. A dynamic model is a model that describes changes through time of a specific process. A process-based model (also known as mechanistic model) is a model in which relationships are described in terms of explicitly stated processes or mechanisms based on established scientific understanding, and model parameters therefore have clear ecological interpretation, defined beforehand. Hybrid models are models that combine correlative and process-based modelling approaches. A correlative model (also known as statistical model) is a model in which available empirical data are used to estimate values for parameters that do not have predefined ecological meaning, and for which processes are implicit rather than explicit. Integrated assessment models are interdisciplinary models that aim to describe the complex relationships between environmental, social, and economic drivers that determine current and future state of the ecosystem and the effects of global change, in order to derive policy-relevant insights. One of the essential characteristics of integrated assessments is the simultaneous consideration of the multiple dimensions of environmental problems.","Europe and Central Asia assessment, Global assessment (1st work programme), Americas assessment, Africa assessment, Asia-Pacific assessment, Land degradation and restoration assessment",NA,21705,16375

"tenure_sua","tenure","","Tenure systems define who can use which Nature’s contributions to people, for how long and under what conditions. Three related aspects of tenure offer a comprehensive understanding of the term. They include (1) tenure as a set of rights, (2) key responsibilities in relation to tenure, and (3) enabling conditions that facilitate governance of tenure. From this combined perspective, tenure is understood as the combination of a set of specific rights that connect the resource users with various aspects of the resource and puts the control and decision-making power in their hands. These rights span social, ecological, economic, and political aspects of tenure, and help provide directions to moving toward effective governance. Rights are connected with responsibilities that range from the duties of the users to maintain the resource to the duties to be performed by the state, and those jointly by both. The exercise of tenure rights can only be possible if certain conditions are meaningfully met because they offer the much required social, ecological, and political environment for the operationalization of tenure rights, performance of the tenure related duties, and necessary security and protection against tenure violations. From an integrated social-ecological (human-environmental) systems perspective, tenure is defined as relationships (also interactions and connections) between people (the users) who seek tenure and between the people (users) and the environment (includes the resource) to which tenure is being sought. Governance of tenure is then about the manner in which these host of relationships, interactions, and connections are addressed and promoted. Tenure in the context of sustainable use of wild species is not a static concept and, therefore, can be best understood as a process and its governance as continuous.","Sustainable use assessment",NA,25468,42012

"terrestrial animal harvesting_sua","terrestrial animal harvesting","","Terrestrial animal harvesting is defined as the removal from their habitat of animals (vertebrates and invertebrates) that spend some or all of their life cycle in terrestrial environments. As for fishing, terrestrial animal harvesting often results in the death of the animal, but it may not in some cases. To reflect both situations, terrestrial animal harvesting has been sub-divided into a lethal and a “non- lethal” category. Hunting is defined as the lethal category of terrestrial animal harvesting which leads to the killing of the animal, such as in trophy hunting. “Non-lethal” terrestrial animal harvesting is defined as the temporary or permanent capture of live animals from their habitat without intended mortality, such as pet trade, falconry or green hunting. Non-lethal harvest of animals also includes removal of parts or products of animals that do not lead to the mortality of the host, such as vicuña fiber or wild honey. Unintended mortality may however occur in this category and the term “non-lethal” is therefore put in quotes.","Sustainable use assessment",NA,25470,42014

"thermodynamics_ldr","thermodynamics","","The science of the relationship between heat, work, temperature, and energy. In broad terms, thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one place to another and from one form to another. The key concept is that heat is a form of energy corresponding to a definite amount of mechanical work. The behaviour of a complex thermodynamic system, such as Earth's atmosphere, can be understood by first applying the principles of states and properties to its component parts—in this case, water, water vapour, and the various gases making up the atmosphere. By isolating samples of material whose states and properties can be controlled and manipulated, properties and their interrelations can be studied as the system changes from state to state.","Land degradation and restoration assessment",NA,25472,42017

"tragedy of the commons_ldr","tragedy of the commons","","Title of an influential 1968 essay by biologist Garrett Hardin, which argued that overuse of common resources is a leading cause of environmental degradation. This was interpreted by some, especially economists and free-market libertarians, to mean that private ownership is preferable to the commons for the stewardship of land, water, minerals, etc. Yet in recent years many have challenged this view on both empirical and philosophical grounds. Professor Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University has been a leading figure in demonstrating the practical utility and sustainability of commons governance regimes, particularly in developing countries. This suggests that the vision of human behaviour implicit in the tragedy of the commons metaphor is not as immutable as many economists assert, and that collective management is an eminently practical governance strategy in many circumstances. The tragedy of the anti-commons is now frequently invoked to describe the problems associated with excessive privatization and fragmentation of property rights, such that collective action for the common good is thwarted.

We build on this definition through reference to the depth, breadth and dynamics of system reorganisation. Depth refers to change that goes beyond addressing the symptoms of environmental change or their proximate drivers, such as new technologies, incentive systems or protected areas, to include changes to underlying drivers, including consumption preferences, beliefs, ideologies and social inequalities (IPBES, 2019; Patterson et al., 2017; Scoones et al., 2015). Breadth refers to change across multiple spheres, with emerging consensus that transformation requires co-evolutionary change across different spheres of society, including personal, economic, political, institutional and technological ones (Harvey, 2010; O’Brien & Sygna, 2013; Pelling et al., 2015; Temper et al., 2018; Westley et al., 2011). Dynamics and processes refer to the emergent patterns of change across ‘depths’, ‘breadths’ and time that unfold as non-linear pathways.

"values_sua","values","","Value systems: Set of values according to which people, societies and organizations regulate their behavior. Value systems can be identified in both individuals and social groups (Pascual et al., 2017). Value (as principle): A value can be a principle or core belief underpinning rules and moral judgments. Values as principles vary from one culture to another and also between individuals and groups (IPBES, 2015). Value (as preference): A value can be the preference someone has for something or for a particular state of the world. Preference involves the act of making comparisons, either explicitly or implicitly. Preference refers to the importance attributed to one entity relative to another one (IPBES, 2015). Value (as importance): A value can be the importance of something for itself or for others, now or in the future, close by or at a distance. This importance can be considered in three broad classes. 1. The importance that something has subjectively, and may be based on experience. 2. The importance that something has in meeting objective needs. 3. The intrinsic Please do not cite, quote or circulate 1733 value of something (IPBES, 2015). Value (as measure): A value can be a measure. In the biophysical sciences, any quantified measure can be seen as a value (IPBES, 2015). Non-anthropocentric value: A non-anthropocentric value is a value centered on something other than human beings. These values can be non-instrumental or instrumental to non-human ends (IPBES, 2015). Intrinsic value: This concept refers to inherent value, that is the value something has independent of any human experience or evaluation. Such a value is viewed as an inherent property of the entity and not ascribed or generated by external valuing agents (Pascual et al., 2017). Anthropocentric value: The value that something has for human beings and human purposes (Pascual et al., 2017). Instrumental value: The value attributed to something as a means to achieving a particular end (Pascual et al., 2017). Non-instrumental value: The value attributed to something as an end in itself, regardless of its utility for other ends. Relational value: The values that contribute to desirable relationships, such as those among people or societies, and between people and nature, as in “Living in harmony with nature” (IPBES, 2015). Integrated valuation: The process of collecting, synthesizing, and communicating knowledge about the ways in which people ascribe importance and meaning of Nature’s contributions to people, to facilitate deliberation and agreement for decision making and planning.","Sustainable use assessment",NA,21795,16444
"values_nxs","values","","Refers to the ways in which people reflect their life goals, beliefs and general guiding principles, opinions or judgements of the importance of specific things in particular situations and contexts (IPBES, 2022a). When considering the values of nature, values can refer to nature itself, how nature contributes to people's quality of life, in addition to the way people express the value of life-supporting processes, functions and systems – interrelating biophysical, spiritual or symbolic aspects (IPBES, 2022a). The IPBES methodological assessment regarding the diverse conceptualization of multiple values of nature and its benefits, including biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services (VA) refers to instrumental, intrinsic and relational value types. It also notes that value pluralism means there are several values which may be equally correct and fundamental to different communities, and yet in conflict with each other (IPBES, 2022a). •Instrumental value: Values, which relate to things that are a means to a desired or valued end or satisfy people's preferences, are the most commonly reported value type in environmental policy documents. They are generally associated with nature as an asset, capital or resource and are strongly related to the concept of ecosystem services. •Intrinsic value: values, which relate to the values of nature expressed independently of any reference to humans as valuers and include entities such as a habitat or species that are worth protecting as ends in-and-of themselves. They are consistent with biocentric worldviews and with the understanding of values as existing objectively in nature. •Relational value: values, which refer to the importance of desirable, meaningful and often reciprocal relationships – beyond means to an end – between humans and nature, and among humans (including across generations) through nature (e.g., sense of place, spirituality, responsibility, care, reciprocity, stewardship) (IPBES, 2022a).","Nexus assessment",NA,21795,88426

Value systems can be identified in both individuals and social groups (Pascual et al., 2017). Value (as principle): A value can be a principle or core belief underpinning rules and moral judgments. Values as principles vary from one culture to another and also between individuals and groups (IPBES/4/INF/13). Value (as preference): A value can be the preference someone has for something or for a particular state of the world. Preference involves the act of making comparisons, either explicitly or implicitly. Preference refers to the importance attributed to one entity relative to another one (IPBES/4/INF/13). Value (as importance): A value can be the importance of something for itself or for others, now or in the future, close by or at a distance. This importance can be considered in three broad classes: The importance that something has subjectively, and may be based on experience. The importance that something has in meeting objective needs. The intrinsic value of something (IPBES/4/INF/13). Value (as measure): A value can be a measure. In the biophysical sciences, any quantified measure can be seen as a value (IPBES/4/INF/13). Non-anthropocentric value: A non-anthropocentric value is a value centred on something other than human beings. These values can be non-instrumental or instrumental to non-human ends (IPBES/4/INF/13). Intrinsic value: This concept refers to inherent value, that is the value something has independent of any human experience and evaluation. Such a value is viewed as an inherent property of the entity and not ascribed or generated by external valuing agents (Pascual et al., 2017). Anthropocentric value: The value that something has for human beings and human purposes (Pascual et al., 2017).

"values of nature_va","values of nature","","When referring to values of ‘nature’, we expand on the concept proposed by Díaz et al. (2015) by recognizing that individual and group understandings of nature are socially constructed, and that different social groups have different conceptualizations of the relationship between the human and non-human world. For IPBES, nature refers loosely to the non-human living world including the scientific categories of biodiversity, ecosystem structure and functioning, evolution, the biosphere, humankind’s shared evolutionary heritage and biocultural diversity. In addition, IPBES recognises other worldviews, including those from IPLCs, in which people recognize the diverse entities and elements of nature such as rivers, mountains, plants, animal species, existing within the planet denoted by categories like Mother Earth and systems of life . Among many IPLCs, nature is often viewed as inextricably linked to humans, not as a separate entity.

"wild species_sua","wild species","","Wild species refers to populations of any species that have not been domesticated through multigenerational selection for particular traits, and which can survive independently of human intervention that may occur in any environment. This does not imply a complete absence of human management and recognizes various intermediate states between wild and domesticated. This assessment excludes feral and introduced populations.","Sustainable use assessment",NA,25563,42159
"wild species watching_sua","wild species watching","","Wild species watching is defined as a non-extractive practice where humans observe, and in some cases interact, with wild species in their natural environment in a way that does not involve the harvest or removal of any part of the organism. Wild species watching activities vary greatly in the level of wild species involvement, ranging from photographing animals from afar to more invasive practices of habituating, feeding and touching animals (UNEP/CMS, 2006, p. 2006). Wild species watching also is an economically important segment of nature-based tourism.","Sustainable use assessment",NA,25564,42160
"wilderness_ga1_sua","wilderness","","Ecosystems, landscapes and seascapes with a very low degree of human influence, at present with full recognition that they are often inhabited and managed by people, and have been so for centuries or millennia, often at low population densities, and therefore their native biodiversity and ecological and evolutionary processes have not been reconfigured by human drivers to a significant degree. Not all areas designated as wilderness conform to this definition, especially in Europe where abandoned agricultural areas ‘managed’ by ‘wild living’ large herbivores are also called wilderness. Some wilderness areas in the world show transition to cultural landscapes with low human influence.","Global assessment (1st work programme), Sustainable use assessment",NA,25565,42161
